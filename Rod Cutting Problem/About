This is a part of assignment of "Algorithms using Java" Using java (CS 501).
This project is a Based on following instruction by professor :

    1. Create a class called RodCuttingProblem. This class should have the followings:
    
      • A method called cutRod that performs the cutting rod algorithm (without memoization) to compute the optimal revenue value 
      • Methods called memoizedCutRod and memoizedCutRodAux that perform the cutting rod algorithm (using the memoization technique) 
        to compute the optimal revenue value 
      • Each technique should implement a counter to count how many times the method is called  (recursively) 
        to solve a problem of rod length _ 
      • Test these algorithms in the main method 
      • Calculate the optimal revenue figures for rods of lengths i = 1,2,3,…,10, using both methods  
      • Your outputs should be a table that shows the following data and results: 
          length  , 
          optimal rev from the cutRod (CR) method, 
          number for times the cutRod method is called to solve the problem of length , 
          optimal rev from the memoizedCutRod (MCR) method,   
          number for times the method is called to solve the problem of length   
       • The output table should have these columns with headers:  Length _, Rev CR, Num Calls CR, Rev MCR, Num Calls MCR 
       • Compare the results from the cutRod and the memoizedCutRod methods  
 
 
     2. Modify the memoizedCutRod method (or implement the extendedBottomUpCutRod method) to keep track of the rod length 
        that generates the optimal solution for each of the rod lengths used in problem 1 above.     
        • Add a column to the output table to show the optimal rod cut results – the lengths of the rods (after the cuts) 
          that yield the optimal revenue values  
        • The output table should now have these columns with headers:  
            Length _, Rev CR, Num Calls CR, Rev MCR, Num Calls MCR, Cut Pieces
