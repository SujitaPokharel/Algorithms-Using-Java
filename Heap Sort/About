This is a part of assignment of "Algorithms using Java" Using java (CS 501).
This project is a Based on following instruction by professor :

    Write a program in Java that performs the Heapsort algorithm. 
    
      a) Create the maxHeapify method.  
      
      b) Implement the buildMaxHeap method and the heapSort method.
      
      c) Test your program by using the following array:  
          int[] array = {10, 15, 8, 12, 5, 2, 20, 7, 18}; 
          
      d) Your output should display the following 3 versions of the array:  
          i. The original input array 
          ii. The array after buildMaxHeap has completed  
          iii. The final sorted array after performing the Heapsort algorithm
