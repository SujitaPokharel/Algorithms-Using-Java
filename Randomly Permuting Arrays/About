This is a part of assignment of "Algorithms using Java" Using java (CS 501).
This project is a Based on following instruction by professor :

    In the class, we discussed 2 techniques for randomly permuting arrays – Permute by Sorting and Randomize in Place. 
    Create a Java class/program called PermuteArrays which contains 2 methods:     
    
      permuteBySorting method  
          • Has this header  public static void permuteBySorting(int[] list)
          • It takes an array of integers as argument and permutes the elements in the array by applying the Permute by Sorting algorithm 
          • In the PermuteArrays class main method, test the permuteBySorting method  
                1. Generate an array of integers with values from 1 to 20 
                2. Display the original array on the screen  
                3. Call the permuteBySorting method and pass this array as the argument 
                4. Display the array again after it got randomized  
 
      randomizeInPlace method that 
          • Has this header  public static void randomizeInPlace(int[] list) 
          • It takes an array of integers as argument and permutes the elements in the array by applying  the Randomize in Place algorithm  
          • In the PermuteArrays class main method, test the randomizeInPlace method  
                1. Generate another array of integers with values from 100 to 120 
                2. Display the original array on the screen 
                3. Call the randomizeInPlace method and pass this array as the argument 
                4. Display the array again after it got randomized
