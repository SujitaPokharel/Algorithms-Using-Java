This is a part of assignment of "Algorithms using Java" Using java (CS 501).
This project is a Based on following instruction by professor :

  Write a program in Java that performs the Insertion Sort algorithm on an array of n numbers. 
  Use the following array in your program as a test case:      
      int[] array = {100, 250, 30, 425, 5, 80, 900, 375};   
 
The program should display the output of the result as shown below:
      Insertion Sort result is 5, 30, 80, 100, 250, 375, 425, 900
