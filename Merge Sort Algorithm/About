This is a part of assignment of "Algorithms using Java" Using java (CS 501).
This project is a Based on following instruction by professor :

     Write a program that performs the Merge Sort algorithm. 
     
     Use the same array in problem 2 as your test case for the program:  
          int[] array = {95, 70, 82, 125, 48, 67, 18, 53};   
          
     The program should display the output of the result as shown below:   
          Merge Sort result is 18, 48, 53, 67, 70, 82, 95, 125
